# Privacy Policy
The "Iâ€™m like you" version

By accessing or using PyLint, you agree to be bound by this Policy and my Terms of Service.

This is a private project to simplify Python projects on GitHub. 
I do only store the `sha-1` sum and the `flake8` output on my server. 
Please acknowledge, that the linting result is stored in plain text files on the server and 
everybody knowing the sha-checksum is able to view the linting result. As this is the only task of PyLint, it does not
collect more data.  See the source-code
https://github.com/PatWie/pylint

## What do I do with your data?

Your data belongs to you and I do not sell or lend any part of your data to any third party. 
This excludes legal obligations to government bodies in various jurisdictions. 
I do not have time to analyze the flake8 outputs.

## Which permission do you grant PyLint?

PyLint only requires minimal permission to your repository. It exclusively has read-only access to your code, which is temporarily downloaded for analyzing.
Further PyLint has the permission to add status messages to commits.

## What happens to your data when you leave PyLint?

As the sha1-sum is anonymous, PyLint currently keep these plain text files.

## What else to know?

This is a beta-like software. Please know, that loosing data might be possible. Further, if the service will be abuse, 
I will consider to shutdown the service or just add a whitelist function. If you expect to produce a heavy load on this service,
I would appreciate if you host you own version.
